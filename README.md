# Expo Template

This is a template for creating an Expo Project on GitPod or Codespaces.

## To Start

1. You will need to start by creating your expo app with the following command and answering the questions about your app.

```
npx create-expo-app@latest
```

2. Next, you will have to `cd` into the new directory created for your app.
   Setup Prettier with the command...

```
npx expo install -- --save-dev prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier
```

Then you should move the `.eslintrc.js` file into the project directory you created for your app with the `npx create-expo-app` command.

3. Now, start the server using the `npm start web` command.
4. You should probably find a tutorial and use the Expo and React Native Docs, often. Here is the link to the [Expo Docs](https://docs.expo.dev) where there is a really quick and excellent tutorial of building a photo app if you think that is helpful.
5. Finally, make sure you commit _constantly_ and _small_.
